# martypc_eframe

This is a front-end for MartyPC based on [eframe](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/master/crates/eframe).

This is the current front-end receiving most of my development effort. 

It can be compiled for native or wasm-unknown-unknown targets. If you install [trunk](https://trunkrs.dev/) you can 
serve the wasm build locally using `trunk serve --config Trunk.toml` from this directory, or use the included `serve.bat` 
if you are on Windows.
