/// The [DisplayManager] trait is implemented by a display manager that combines the facilities of
/// a windowing system (Such as winit/eframe), graphics backend (such as Pixels/wgpu), and a GUI
/// (such as egui). It is a difficult task to create an interface trait that can handle the
/// different requirements of each of these systems, so the trait is designed to be as flexible as
/// possible.
///
/// The trait concerns itself with the creation and rendering of `display targets`, which are
/// indexed by integer handles. A display target is not necessarily a unique native window, but can
/// be a texture or GUI widget/internal window. A display target is simply anything that can
/// represent the output of a [VideoRenderer] (which is just a struct now, but will be a trait in
/// the future).
///
/// In some cases, the trait is implemented on top of a pre-initialized backend and gui, such
/// as when we are running under `eframe`. In this case, the trait is implemented on top of egui's
/// Viewport system, and no concept of a native window is present. For this reason, we talk about
/// `viewports` instead of windows. A `Viewport` is a region of the screen that can be rendered to
/// natively, and is the equivalent of a window in a windowing system such as Windows, macOS, or
/// Linux. On the web, there is no concept of a window, so how `viewports` are handled is
/// implementation-dependent.
///
/// Being intended for use in PC emulators, [DisplayManager] handles the concept of a `Video Card`.
/// This is not necessarily a discrete card in an emulated system, but the concept seems to fit
/// and I couldn't think of a better name. A `Video Card` is a logical representation of an emulated
/// display device that can be connected to one *or more* display targets. This is a key detail -
/// we can have multiple viewports displaying the same video card output, with different parameters
/// and potentially different scaling/shaders applied. When creating a context, a [VideoCardId] can
/// be optionally supplied.  If no card id is supplied, the display target will simply not have
/// a video card associated with it - this is fine, a display target can render other things,
/// such as debug displays or GUI widgets.
///
/// [DisplayManager] is extensively generic. The generic parameters are:
/// * B: Graphics `Backend`
/// * G: GUI Context
/// * Vh: Viewport Handle
/// * V: Viewport Context
/// * C: Native Context (such as winit's ActiveEventLoop, or egui's Context)
///
/// If an implementation doesn't require any of these specific types, they can be set to `()`.
///
/// * `Backend`: An implementation of the [DisplayBackend] trait. A graphics backend is a wrapper
///     around a graphics API that provides methods for texture allocation, and maintains a cpu
///     addressable pixel buffer that can be rendered to by a [VideoRenderer].
///
/// * `GUI Context`: A context object that is used to render GUI elements. This is typically used
///     when the display manager is hosting a GUI instead of running on top of one, such as a
///     implementation of a wgpu backend rendering egui. When a Display Manager is hosted on top
///     of a GUI such as eframe, this context is likely minimal or empty.
///
/// * `Event loop abstraction`: An abstraction over the event loop of the windowing system. This
///     is required primarily to support creation of windows under Winit 0.30, which now requires
///     window creation to be done in the event loop. If no event loop is required for window
///     creation this type parameter can be ().
