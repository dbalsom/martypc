//! The Frontend Common library provides facilities, data types and traits common to all front ends.
//! This avoids duplication of code and type definitions.
//!
//! Various Managers are provided here to help with the task of managing resources and state.
//! - TimeStepManager: Manages the timing of the emulator via callbacks that fire at specified
//!     intervals, to allow desynchronized guest FPS targeting vs GUI updates.
//! - ResourceManager: Manages the loading and unloading of resources, such as ROMs, disk images,
//!     cartridges, etc.
//! - DisplayManager: Manages the display of the emulator, including window management, scaling,
//!     aspect ratio, shaders (if applicable to platform), etc.
//! - MachineManager: Manages the parsing of machine configurations and the creation of machines
//!     from those configurations.
//! - RomManager: Manages the loading and resolution of ROMs based on requirements from a machine
//!     configuration
//! - FloppyManager: Manages the loading and unloading of floppy disk images
//! - VhdManager: Manages the loading and unloading of VHD disk images
//! - CartridgeManager: Manages the loading and unloading of ROM cartridges (PCjr specific)
