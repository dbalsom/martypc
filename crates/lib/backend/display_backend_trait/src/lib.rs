//! Defines a [DisplayBackend] trait that can be implemented to abstract various
//! display backends such as Pixels or (eventually) SDL.
//!
//! [DisplayBackend] has the concept of a `buffer` which is the raw u8 pixel
//! data to be displayed during rendering, and a `surface` which is the
//! destination target for rendering. These may not be the same size, ie, when
//! hardware scaling is in effect. In general, the surface should be resized
//! when the attached window is resized.
//!
//! The render method takes a [VideoRenderer] trait object, defined by a specific
//! frontend. The job of a [VideoRenderer] is to post-process the raw framebuffer
//! output of the emulation core's video devices. Typically, this involves converting
//! indexed color data to RGBA.
