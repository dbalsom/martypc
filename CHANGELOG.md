## [0.3.0](https://github.com/dbalsom/martypc/releases/tag/0.2.3) (2024-XX-XX)

### New Sound System

* MartyPC's original sound system only supported the PC speaker, and had a very awkward design (one might call it a gross hack)
  For 0.3.0, MartyPC has a new sound system. The emulator core determines how many sound producing devices are installed and creates
  crossbeam channels for each device to send samples to the frontend, which is responsible for mixing and playback.

### New Devices

* #### Adlib Music Card

  * The first audio device in MartyPC besides the PC speaker is the Adlib Music Card. OPL2 emulation is provided by the accurate nuked-opl3 library. 
    This marks the first device I have not emulated myself, but the time it would take to research FM synthesis and produce anything near nuked-opl3 
    quality would have you waiting for OPL2 emulation for another decade.

* #### VGA 

  * The IBM VGA card gets an initial implementation at last. MartyPC's VGA is based off its EGA implementation, with appropriate changes and additions.
    Clocked up to 28Mhz, the VGA is an expensive device to run at a character-clock accurate rate, so you may need a fast computer.
    Aperture definitions may not be final. Mode 13h and ModeX/Y are supported. 

### Frontend Bug Fixes / Improvements

  * File tree browser: 
    * Display directories before files
    * Display correct icons for different file types

### Core Bug Fixes / Improvements

* TGA: Implement hi-res 2bpp mode (PCJr Colorpaint, etc)
* FDC: Fix PCjr keyboard watchdog timer handling
* BUS/PPI: Improve PCjr keyboard handling  
* BUS: New sound system. Removed cpal dependency from core. Core now produces samples and sends them to the frontend for mixing and playback.
* PPI: Fixed memory bank DIP switch masks for memory configurations less than <64K.

### Debugger Bug Fixes / Improvements

* Memory Visualizer: Add a new debug tool that graphically displays a portion of memory as 1bpp, 2bpp, 4bpp or 8bpp pixels.

### Distribution Changes

* Added new definition for an alternate 64K PCjr ROM dump (Thanks ImperatorBanana)
* Added new definition for an alternate 32K BASIC C1.0 ROM (thanks Torinde)

### Dependency Updates


## [0.2.2](https://github.com/dbalsom/martypc/releases/tag/0.2.2) (2024-06-22)

### New devices

* #### LoTech 2MB EMS Board
  * Added emulation of the [LoTech 2MB EMS Card](https://texelec.com/product/lo-tech-ems-2-mb/)
    This card can be added to any machine configuration via the `lotech_ems` overlay. You can specify the window segment
    and IO base address. However, these values must match one of the values supported by the real hardware or the driver 
    won't work with it. 

* #### Game Port and Joystick
  * Added emulation of the IBM game port card, and basic keyboard-based joystick emulation. There is a new keyboard 
    hotkey (`JoyToggle`) to turn this on and off (provisionally defined as Ctrl-F9), as well as configurable 
    `joystick_keys` in the configuration you can use to define what keys control the joystick.
  * PCJr and Tandy 1000 machines will have a game port installed automatically. You can add a game port to any PC or XT
    configuration via the `game_port` overlay.
  * Two two-button, two-axis joysticks are assumed to be connected when you specify a game port. 
    Different joystick configurations may be supported in the future. 

* #### PCJr Cartridge Slots
  * Added support in the core, frontend and GUI for PCJr cartridges in JRipCart format. Inserting or removing a cart
    will reboot the machine. You will only see the cartridge slots when using the PCJr machine.

### Frontend Bug Fixes / Improvements

* Added a new resource type 'cartridge' and menu interface to browse and select PCJr Cartridges.

### Core Bug Fixes / Improvements

* SERIAL: Fixed many issues in MartyPC's 8250 UART emulation. PCjr now boots without error code 'D' and Checkit2 serial
  diagnostics also pass.
* BUS: Implemented a `terminal_port` configuration option under `[machine]` in the main configuration. Writes to this 
  port will be printed to the host's terminal.
* MC6845: Fixed an issue preventing entering vertical total adjust period if vertical total was 127. Fixes some Hercules
  display issues.
* HERCULES: Increased the size of the Hercules' display field to accomodate some CGA emulators that drive the MDA
  monitor slightly out of sync (Fixes BBSIMCGA)
* CGA: Added CGA's external mode register to debug output
* MACHINE: Added a facility to record disassembly listings from running code. The output filename is set by 
  `disassembly_file` under `[machine]` in the main configuration.
  Basically, this feature saves instruction disassembly to a hash table by CS:IP.  Modification of code segments will 
  override previous disassembly, so it is most useful to toggle this feature on and off for specified periods.

### Debugger Bug Fixes / Improvements

* Serial Status window: Displays serial port registers and statistics.
* IO Status Window
  * Added a 'reset' button to reset all the port counters.
  * Added the last read byte value for each port
  * Fixed panic/crash when resetting machine with the IO Stats window open and scrolled. 

### Distribution Changes

* Added a SvarDOS-based MartyPC boot diskette to media/floppies/boot.
  This disk will load the LoTech EMS driver and CTmouse driver.
* Moved FreeDOS to media/floppies/DOS
* Added SvarDOS build 20240201 diskettes to media/floppies/DOS
* Added ctmouse v1.91 (last working version for Non-VGA) to media/floppies/utilties/mouse
* Added LoTech 2MB EMS card utilities to media/utilities/EMS
* Added JOYCALIB to media/utilities/joystick
* Updated GLaBIOS 0.2.6 ROMS for a bugfix when int 10h vector is overridden

### Dependency Updates

* Set rustc minimum version to 1.76
* Update egui to 0.27.2
* Update wgpu to 0.19.4

## [0.2.1](https://github.com/dbalsom/martypc/releases/tag/0.2.1) (2024-06-09)

### New BIU logic

* 0.2.0 introduced new BIU logic. Unfortunately, 0.2.0 took so long that this 'new' logic already needed 
  replacement. With the discovery of the 8088's 7-cycle bus access time, far simpler BIU logic is possible and has been 
  implemented in 0.2.1. For more information, see 
  [my corresponding blog post](https://martypc.blogspot.com/2024/02/the-complete-bus-logic-of-intel-8088.html).

* Along with this new logic comes a slightly different cycle log format; I'm probably the only person on earth that reads
  these logs, but it's worth mentioning. Several old state columns are gone, and now bus and T-cycles are displayed within 
  two separate 'pipeline slots'. 

### New CPU Framework

* MartyPC now has a framework to support multiple CPU types, so we can have CPUs other than the Intel 8088. 
  There is a slight performance hit involved in not hardcoding a specific CPU, but I believe there are some strategies
  I can use to mitigate this.

### New CPU Type

* An initial implementation of the NEC V20 has been added. All native-mode V20 instructions are implemented (except BRKEM).
  This is not cycle-accurate yet, as it was copied and modified from the 8088.
* The Arduino8088 project and the test generation engine of MartyPC were refactored and
  improved to enable generation of a CPU test suite for the V20, which will be used to incrementally improve V20 emulation
  accuracy over time. 8080 emulation mode will be added in the future.
  The V20 test suite can be found [here](https://github.com/singleStepTests/v20).
* You can add a V20 to any 8088-based machine by adding the `cpu_v20` overlay.

### New Machines

* Added Tandy 1000 and IBM PCJr machine types and ROM definitions. These are still very much a work in progress.
  * Tandy 1000 is mostly functional, and can accept a ibm_xebec hard disk controller (I will eventually dump the Tandy
    hard disk controller ROM, but it is a Xebec controller).
  * IBM PCJr needs cartridge browser support and PIO mode implemented for the floppy disk controller.
    * RAW cartridge images can be loaded as ROMs using the standard ROM definitions; however this is less than ideal.
      I will be adding support for standard PCJr ROM dump formats.

### New Video Types

* To go with these new systems, there is now a TGA graphics type. Again, a work in progress. 
  * Tandy BIOS identifies the TGA and will boot into 8x9 text mode. Display apertures were tweaked for TGA to support
    this "tall" mode.
  * TGA adapter operates very differently from other adapter types as it does not have its own VRAM. 
  * New core functionality was required to allow mapping of MMIO reads and writes back to system memory.
  * High-resolution 640x200 2bpp mode not yet implemented.

* PCJr graphics are implemented as a subtype of TGA adapter
* Initial support for Hercules graphics card as a subtype of MDA adapter. Still a bit glitchy.

### Frontend Bug Fixes / Improvements

* Added missing overlay for dual 360k floppy configuration (thanks DragomirPazura)
* Fixed loading of keyboard mapping files
* Added CPI (Cycles Per Instruction) to benchmark mode.

### Debugger Bug Fixes / Improvements

* Added cycle stopwatch UI to CPU Control window. The stopwatch allows you to set two 'breakpoints' and measure execution
  time between them.
* 'Step-over' logic overhauled. Step-over cycle timeout removed. A step over may not terminate, but this is in line with 
  other debuggers. On further feedback, dropping you off in a random location after timeout was not useful.
  * The expected return address will be displayed in the CPU Control window in the event a step over does not return.
* You can now step-over `rep` string operations. 
* Re-entrant instructions such as `rep` string operations and `hlt` will remain at top of disassembly until completed
  and will not flood the instruction history with repeated entries
* Instruction history now shows when hardware interrupts, traps and NMIs occur (in dark red)
* Instruction history now shows when jumps were taken (in dark green)
* New IO Statistics display
    * Shows you each IO port accessed, port description, and number of reads and writes.
* Overhauled PPI viewer (work in progress)
* Added tooltips to CPU Control buttons to clarify operations

### Core Bug Fixes / Improvements

* VALIDATOR: Improvements to CPU validation system to support initial generation of V20 tests.
* VALIDATOR: Improvements to test generation allow prefetched tests for 8088/V20
* 8080: Fixed panic due to microcode slice overrun (Thanks Vutshi)
* 8080: Implemented all undefined flags except for division
* 8088/V20: Corrected Trap delay after trap flag pop (Fixes Landmark Service Diagnostics)
* 8088: Refactored instruction decode to a table-based lookup, replaced custom flags with values from group decode ROM.
* 8088: Converted SegmentOverride enum to Option<Segment>, simplifying segment resolution logic in many places
* 8088: New 7-cycle bus access logic
* 8088: Refactored CycleText log format
* 8088: Added cyle stopwatch support
* 8088: Don't count individual REP iterations toward instruction counter
* 8088: Fixed call stack tracing (recursive calls will still cause overflow)
  * Reduced size of call stack history to avoid ridiculously tall windows
* 8088: Fixed cycle count reporting in Instruction History
* 8088: Added Interrupt, Trap and NMI history types
* EGA: Can now specify EGA dipswitch in machine configuration.
  * Added an `ibm_ega_on_cga` config overlay with the right dipswitch for running FantasyLand
* BUS: Require IoDevice trait implementations to provide port description strings
* BUS: Add new functionality for MMIO trait implementors to access main memory (Supports TGA)
* BUS: Add PCJr-specific keyboard logic to generate NMI on keypress
* PIT: Preserve latch value across mode changes (Fixes Tandy 1000 POST)
* PPI: More accurate PPI emulation
  * Tandy 1000 and IBM PCJr specific PPI details added
  * Control register implemented, and PPI group modes are now tracked
  * New state dump format for new frontend PPI Viewer
  * Implemented keyboard scancode serializer for PCJr (Still has some bugs)
* CGA: Fixed last-line CRTC flag logic. Fixes some severe glitches in Area 5150 I didn't notice because I have only been
       testing the first and last effect. (Thanks Sudo)

### Known Issues

* Area5150: Some minor glitches during the Elephant effect text scroll (left side character glitch) and the end credits
  have a periodic black scanline inserted. These were introduced with some new CRTC logic that is demonstrably more 
  correct in other scenarios, but clearly has a few bugs to iron out.

## [0.2.0](https://github.com/dbalsom/martypc/releases/tag/0.2.0b) (2024-04-01)

### New Features

* #### New Display Manager Framework

        * Full overscan
        * Full display field including hblank and vblank periods (for debugging)
    * Hardware aspect correction: Aspect correction is now performed in the shader for reduced CPU load
    * Multi-window support: Define additional output windows in the configuration file
        * Multiple windows can display the same video card, with different display options
        * Windows can be set to a fixed size or scale factor, or made completely resizable
        * Windows can be pinned 'always on top'
        * Windows can be toggled full-screen via CONTROL-ALT-ENTER hotkey
    * Shader support: A basic CRT shader is built into the new display scaler
        * Internal shader features:
            * Barrel distortion
            * Corner radius (rounded corners)
            * Monochrome phosphor simulation
            * Scanline emulation synchronized to emulated video resolution
        * Presets for the internal scaler can be defined in configuration and applied to different windows

* #### New ROM Definition Framework
    * ROM set definitions are no longer hardcoded. They will be read from ROM set definition TOML files in the ROM
      directory.
    * Add your own custom ROM sets or contribute missing ROM definitions to MartyPC!

* #### New Machine Configuration Framework
    * Define multiple Machine hardware configurations, name them, select them in the main config or via command line
      argument.
    * Configure the amount of conventional memory, the number and type of floppy drives, video cards, serial ports and
      more!

* #### New Resource Manager Framework
    * Paths are to 'resource ids' are now fully configurable, and facilities to build file trees are provided.
      MartyPC can create needed directories on startup. The Floppy and VHD browsers have been rewritten to take
      advantage of this new system, and so now you can organize your media directories into subdirectories for
      convenience.

* #### EGA Video Card
    * EGA is back! A character-clocked EGA implementation is here, although it may still be a bit rough around the
      edges.
      EGA will continue to be polished in upcoming releases.
    * Features:
        * Functional emulation of each of the 5 LSI chips on the EGA
        * Per-scanline Pel panning - effects like the wibble in Beverly Hills Cop work
        * Line compare register - See the status bar in Catacombs 3d!
        * CGA compatibility mode - Play Alleycat!
        * Software fonts - change your DOS font, or see a graphical mouse cursor in text mode (Norton Utilities 6.0)
    * Known issues:
        * Visual glitches with n0p's Windows 3.0 EGA driver patched for 8088
        * Some more obscure registers not properly emulated / investigated (SOM, etc.)
        * Aperture definitions / adjustments not final
        * Implementation may be slow in parts - more optimization needed (SIMD?)

* #### MDA Video Card
    * Not quite as a flashy as EGA, but the MDA card type is now also supported, and moreover, you can install an MDA
      alongside a CGA or EGA card for a dual head display.
    * 9th column rendering and underline attributes supported
    * Includes the framework for a LPT port, which will now be detected
    * Known issues:
        * Needs optimization - due to the 9-dot character clock making 64-bit aligned writes impossible, MDA is
          currently slower to emulate than EGA.
* #### New Keyboard System
    * MartyPC now performs low-level emulation of a Model F keyboard instead of directly translating OS input events to
      the core
        * Model M emulation to come
    * Configurable typematic rate and delay
    * International keyboard layouts are now supported via translation files.
        * Translation files support all keycode names defined by w3c: [https://w3c.github.io/uievents-code/#code-value-tables](https://w3c.github.io/uievents-code/#code-value-tables)
        * Translation files can define direct scancode mappings or full macros
        * Initial translation files include US, UK and IT layouts. More to come. Help appreciated!
    * Configurable hotkey support
